The library for internal use
============================

Dmitigr Internal - general purpose internal library of components, including
programs, functions, classes - everything, which can be used in various projects.

This library doesn't pretends to be used by anyone directly. The main goal of
this library is to store the (potentially) reusable code and share it for our
own projects. Every bit can be changed without care of the backward compatibility.
